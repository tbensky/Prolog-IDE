# Prolog-IDE: A browser-based IDE for programming in Prolog.

I'm trying to study Prolog, in particular [Constraint Logic Programming](https://github.com/tbensky/Prolog-CLP). I found myself making progress, until it
suddenly dawned on me that I working on Prolog using the macOS CLI. I was literally editing in VSCodium and then manually running SWI Prolog from an XTerm. This cycle got kind of irritating, so I went looking for a Prolog IDE. 

[SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org) seems very polished, but I wanted something that ran locally, and I don't want to use [EMACS](https://www.metalevel.at/ediprolog/). I looked at trying to morph Eclipse or Jetbeans, but didn't even know where to start.  [BBEdit](https://barebones.com) and [TextWrangler](https://barebones.com) will execute Applescript from within the editor, so conceivably SWI Prolog could be run that way, but I never understood Applescript. Next I looked at Python's [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and [wxPython](https://wxpython.org), thinking maybe I'd write some OS-level text editorr and shel out to SWI Prolog from there.  I made a simple editor, but it was ugly.

So, I decided on 


 Found winbox
